# 2026-02-18 M5 QA Report (CLI Rerun)

## Build and Reference

* Baseline branch: `feature/milestone-5`
* Ticket under validation: `M5-04`
* Related implementation tickets: `M5-01` through `M5-03`

## Environment

* OS: Windows (`win32`)
* Node.js: `v24.13.1`
* npm: `11.8.0`
* Runtime validation: local Vite dev server
* Manual browser verification: user follow-up completed on PC and mobile (PC pass, mobile load issue observed)

## Executed Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-01 | Full regression tests pass | Pass | `npm run test` -> 14 files, 55 tests passed |
| QA-02 | Production build succeeds | Pass | `npm run build` succeeded (`injectManifest` precache 8 entries) |
| QA-03 | App runtime boots locally | Pass | `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4258 --strictPort` booted (Vite ready in 297ms) |
| QA-04 | Manual install flow on desktop/mobile supported browsers | Partial | User-reported check: PC passes; mobile has page-load issue |
| QA-05 | Service worker mobile-load hardening | Pass | Added navigation fallback for non-OK responses in `src/sw.ts` |
| QA-06 | Service worker navigation-timeout fallback | Not implemented | No timeout-based navigation fallback is implemented in `src/sw.ts`; criterion kept for traceability |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (M5-04)

* Completed in this run:
  * Automated validations (`test`, `build`) are green.
  * Dev runtime boot is confirmed.
  * Service worker fetch handling was hardened to reduce mobile page-load failures.
  * Ticket status docs were synchronized with this report refresh.
* Pending external/manual:
  * Verify on mobile that page load succeeds after updating to the latest build.

## Open Issues

* No automated test/build failures.
* No known blocking code defects from automated validation.
* Mobile manual verification found a page-load issue on mobile while PC passed.
* A service worker fallback fix was applied, but mobile confirmation is still pending.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M5-04`: `Partial`
* Milestone `M5`: `Partial`
