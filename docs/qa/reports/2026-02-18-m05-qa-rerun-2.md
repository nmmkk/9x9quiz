# 2026-02-18 M5 QA Report (CLI Rerun 2)

## Build and Reference

* Baseline branch: `feature/milestone-5`
* Ticket under validation: `M5-04`
* Related implementation tickets: `M5-01` through `M5-03`

## Environment

* OS: Windows (`win32`)
* Node.js: `v24.13.1`
* npm: `11.8.0`
* Runtime validation: local Vite dev server
* Manual browser verification: pending mobile re-check after latest service-worker fallback hardening

## Executed Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-01 | Full regression tests pass | Pass | `npm run test` -> 14 files, 55 tests passed |
| QA-02 | Production build succeeds | Pass | `npm run build` succeeded (`injectManifest` precache 8 entries / 246.91 KiB) |
| QA-03 | App runtime boots locally | Pass | `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4260 --strictPort` booted (Vite ready in 313ms) |
| QA-04 | Requested runtime port availability check | Partial | `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4258 --strictPort` failed: port already in use |
| QA-05 | Manual install and offline page-load checks on mobile | Pending | Requires device/browser verification outside CLI |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (M5-04)

* Completed in this run:
  * Automated validations (`test`, `build`) are green.
  * Dev runtime boot is confirmed on an available strict port.
  * Evidence is refreshed with command outputs from this rerun.
* Pending external/manual:
  * Verify on mobile that page load succeeds after updating to the latest build.
  * Verify mobile install flow and post-install launch behavior.

## Open Issues

* No automated test/build failures.
* No known blocking code defects from this automated rerun.
* Mobile manual verification remains the only blocker for closing `M5-04`.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M5-04`: `Partial`
* Milestone `M5`: `Partial`
