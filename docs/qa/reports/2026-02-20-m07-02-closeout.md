| QA-01 | CI-equivalent tests succeed | Pass | `npm run test` -> 14 files, 55 tests passed |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (M7-02)

* Completed in this run:
  * CI workflow exists and validates `npm ci` + `npm run test` + `npm run build`.
  * Required status check policy is configured on `main`.
  * Validation evidence is captured with command results.
* Pending external/manual:
  * First PR CI pass on remote branch is still recommended as operational smoke, but not required to keep policy active.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M7-02`: `Completed`
* Next execution focus: `M7-03` (GitHub Pages deployment workflow)
