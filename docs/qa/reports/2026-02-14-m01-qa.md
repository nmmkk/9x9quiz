## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (docs/reference/design.md)

* Completed in this run:
  * Automated validations (`test`, `build`) are green.
  * Core scoring, weighted draw, and high-score persistence rules are covered by tests.
* Pending manual verification:
  * Full-session completion walkthrough in all modes (10/20/30).
  * Mobile and desktop visual usability confirmation.

## Open Issues

* No automated test/build failures.
* Manual browser verification is still required to close all release gates.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M1-07`: `Partial`
* Complete after running manual browser QA scenarios and checking remaining release checklist items.
