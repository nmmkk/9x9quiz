## Build and Reference

* Baseline branch: `feature/milestone-7`
* Ticket under validation: `M7-02`
* Related policy docs: `docs/reference/web-release-strategy.md`, `docs/release/checklist.md`

## Environment

* OS: Windows (`win32`)
* Node.js: `v24.13.1`
* npm: `11.8.0`
* CI workflow file under test: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Executed Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-01 | CI-equivalent test command succeeds | Pass | `npm run test` -> 14 files, 55 tests passed |
| QA-02 | CI-equivalent build command succeeds | Pass | `npm run build` succeeded (`injectManifest` precache 8 entries / 246.91 KiB) |
| QA-03 | Branch protection API dry-run | Partial | `gh api repos/nmmkk/9x9quiz/branches/main/protection` -> HTTP 403 (`Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public`) |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (M7-02)

* Completed in this run:
  * CI workflow exists and runs deterministic `npm ci` + `test` + `build` sequence.
  * Local command-level validation for test and build is green.
  * Required-check policy and fallback merge gate are documented.
* Pending external/manual:
  * GitHub-side branch protection required-check enforcement is blocked by current repository plan/visibility.
  * First PR CI pass evidence is pending remote PR execution.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M7-02`: `Partial`
* Next execution focus: resolve branch protection availability, then capture first PR CI pass evidence.
