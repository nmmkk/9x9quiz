## Build and Reference

* Baseline commit: `b9bbfbd` (`test: add M2-05 i18n coverage and regression checks`)
* Ticket under validation: `M2-06`

## Environment

* OS: Windows (`win32`)
* Node.js: `v24.13.1`
* npm: `11.8.0`
* Runtime validation: local Vite dev server
* Manual browser verification: pending interactive desktop/mobile walkthrough outside CLI

## Executed Scenarios

| ID | Scenario | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QA-01 | Unit and regression tests pass | Pass | `npm run test` -> 5 files, 19 tests passed |
| QA-02 | Production build succeeds | Pass | `npm run build` succeeded |
| QA-03 | App runtime boots locally | Pass | `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4181 --strictPort` booted |
| QA-04 | Locale storage read/write/default behavior | Pass | `src/shared/i18n/__tests__/localeStorage.test.ts` |
| QA-05 | Catalog key parity and fallback behavior | Pass | `src/shared/i18n/__tests__/catalog.test.ts` |
| QA-06 | Existing quiz and high-score regressions remain green | Pass | `src/features/quiz/domain/__tests__/draw.test.ts`, `src/features/quiz/domain/__tests__/scoring.test.ts`, `src/shared/storage/__tests__/highScoreStorage.test.ts` |
| QA-07 | Default document language and runtime lang-sync wiring are present | Pass | `index.html` (`<html lang="ja-JP">`), `src/shared/i18n/I18nProvider.tsx` (`document.documentElement.lang = locale`) |
| QA-08 | Full manual localized flow (Title -> Mode -> Quiz -> Result) for 10/20/30 modes | Pending | Interactive browser walkthrough not executed in this CLI session |
| QA-09 | Manual visual verification at ~360x640 and desktop widths | Pending | Interactive viewport checks not executed in this CLI session |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage (M2-06)

* Completed in this run:
  * Automated validations (`test`, `build`) are green.
  * Dev runtime boot is confirmed.
  * Locale persistence and catalog fallback coverage are validated by tests.
  * QA evidence is recorded and status docs are synchronized.
* Pending:
  * Manual localized end-to-end browser flow verification.
  * Manual mobile/desktop visual verification in an interactive browser session.

## Open Issues

* No automated test/build failures.
* No known blocking code defects from this run.
* Manual browser QA evidence is still required to mark ticket fully completed.

## Status Recommendation

* Ticket `M2-06`: `Partial`
* Milestone `M2`: remains `Partial` until pending manual checks are confirmed.
