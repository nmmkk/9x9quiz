# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Triage and fix the mobile page-load issue found during manual `M5-04` verification (PC is confirmed OK), then rerun desktop/mobile install-flow checks and update `docs/qa/reports/2026-02-18-m05-qa-rerun.md`.
2. After mobile verification passes, set `M5-04` to `Completed`, mark milestone `M5` as `Completed`, and start `M6-01`.
3. During M6 planning/refinement, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン), `N-10` (段ごとの正解率カードから段別問題へ直行), and `N-11` (成績リセット機能) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
