# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Implement `M4-03` to add missed-fact mini-review (3 questions).
2. Implement `M4-04` to add table mastery visibility panel.
3. Implement `M4-05` to add adaptive-practice regression tests.
4. During M4 planning/refinement, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.
5. Before `M5-01`, confirm offline cache scope and update strategy constraints documented in `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
