# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Start `M3-02` to add positive feedback message variation framework.
2. Implement `M3-03` to add lightweight feedback effects with reduced-motion guardrails.
3. Execute `M3-04` test/regression coverage for engagement behavior.
4. Complete `M3-05` QA/reporting and status-doc synchronization.
5. Before `M5-01`, confirm offline cache scope and update strategy constraints documented in `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
