# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Define the next milestone priorities (for example language toggle rollout, multiplication-table-range options, and high-score-update message variations).
2. Prepare implementation-ready tickets and build order for the next milestone.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
