# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Complete pending manual verification for `M5-04` (desktop online/offline transition and desktop/mobile install flow), then set `M5-04` to `Completed`.
2. After `M5-04` completion, mark milestone `M5` as `Completed` and start `M6-01`.
3. During M6 planning/refinement, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
