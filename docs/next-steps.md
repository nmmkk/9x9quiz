# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Implement `M4-06` to execute QA pass and sync status docs.
2. Before `M5-01`, confirm offline cache scope and update strategy constraints documented in `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.
3. During M4 QA planning, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.
4. Keep release-checklist assumptions aligned as M4 moves toward completion.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
