# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Start `M6-01` from `docs/roadmap/implementation/m06-native-packaging-pilot.md`.
2. During M6 planning/refinement, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン), `N-10` (段ごとの正解率カードから段別問題へ直行), and `N-11` (成績リセット機能) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.
3. Keep milestone closeout evidence for M5 linked from `docs/qa/reports/2026-02-18-m05-qa-rerun-2.md` when preparing M6 tickets.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
