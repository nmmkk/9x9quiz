# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Start M2-02 and externalize all core-screen copy through localization keys.
2. Execute M2-03 to finalize learner-friendly `ja-JP` text and add the copy reference note.
3. Execute M2-04 and M2-05 to apply localization-aware UI adjustments and complete i18n test coverage.
4. Complete M2-06 with manual QA evidence and status-document synchronization.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
