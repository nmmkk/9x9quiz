# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Implement `M5-01` to add service worker app-shell caching for offline-after-first-load.
2. Implement `M5-02` to add update strategy and cache version management.
3. Implement `M5-03` to add installable PWA metadata and install UX baseline.
4. Implement `M5-04` to execute offline/PWA QA pass and sync status docs.
5. During M5 planning/refinement, evaluate `N-09` (正解進捗の可視化ゲージ/アイコン) from `docs/roadmap/improvement-ideas.md`.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
