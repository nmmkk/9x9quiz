# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. M1 is complete. Define the next milestone and add a new ticket set under `docs/roadmap/implementation/`.
2. If preparing release, execute deployment/runbook tasks that are outside M1 roadmap scope.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
