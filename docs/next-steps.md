# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Complete pending manual browser verification for M2-06 (localized full flow and viewport checks), then mark M2 as completed.
2. After M2 closure, define the next milestone priorities (for example language toggle rollout or post-MVP gameplay expansion).

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
