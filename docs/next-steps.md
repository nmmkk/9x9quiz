# Next Steps

## Immediate

1. Kick off `M8-04` and capture QA evidence for progress indicator, direct-jump flow, and protected reset flow.
2. Sync milestone/status docs after `M8-04` validation closes.
3. Keep `M6-01` architecture decision (`docs/reference/native-strategy.md`) as a deferred option and postpone `M6-02` onward until product priorities require native packaging.
4. Optional: run one `workflow_dispatch` deploy rerun on `main` and record run URL as additional operational evidence.

## Documentation Follow-Through

1. Keep `docs/current-state.md` aligned whenever ticket status changes.
2. Record manual verification artifacts under `docs/qa/reports/`.
3. Update `docs/roadmap/implementation/build-order.md` when dependencies or statuses change.
